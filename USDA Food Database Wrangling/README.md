## USDA Food Database Wrangling and Nutritional Analysis

Project Overview
The USDA National Nutrient Database is a rich source of nutritional information but is distributed in a complex, deeply nested JSON format. This project focuses on transforming this semi-structured data into a clean, flat DataFrame. The ultimate goal is to enable straightforward analysis, such as identifying nutrient-dense foods and comparing the nutritional profiles of different food groups.

__Technologies Used__
